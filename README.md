This requires TouchDesigner 099. You can download TouchDesigner for free here:

If you use the free TouchDesigner licence, you will have to adjust the resolution. Simply locate the node called "constant1" and change x to 1280 and y to 720.
If the project won't work, your GPU is probably to old to run GLSL 4.3 and higher, which is required here.
